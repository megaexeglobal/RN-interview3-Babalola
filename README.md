# GETTING STARTED

-   Please make sure to download node on your machine
-   If **EXPO-CLI** is not installed please make sure to do so by running `npm install -g expo-cli` in your terminal
-   Go to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed
-   After everything you can run `npm start` or `expo start` to run the metro bundler server so that you can view the application on an emulator.
-   If you don't have an emulator (through android studio or xcode) you can use your phone for development. Just download **_Expo Go_** on from playstore or apple app store. Once you download the app use the barcode generated when you run the application to get the application on your phone.





# the approach used to solve the tasks
I embraced a component-based approach to address the tasks at hand. This approach enabled me to develop a variety of reusable components, greatly streamlining the process of modifying elements with efficiency and effectiveness.

# challenges faced 
During the execution of this task, I encountered two primary challenges. The first was related to the nesting of navigation routes. However, I successfully overcame this obstacle by isolating them into individual components. The second challenge pertained to the onboarding images, unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to find a resolution for this issue.
